Android project template which follows the google-standard compliance. This android project template is using the jetpack component which is recommended by Google. Also, it avoids deprecation such as the usage of kotlin synthetic, hence, we are use data binding instead.

## How to Use
These are things you have to do in order to get your project ready.
#### Setup google-services.json
Rename google-services.json.example to google-services.json, and then replace its content with actual json file.

## Important Notes
- Use jetpack data binding instead of kotlin synthetic.
- Use firebase crashlytics
